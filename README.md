Fake News Detection using Machine Learning:

This project was created during a hackathon organized by Google Developer Group (GDG) On Campus and focuses on identifying misleading news content using machine learning techniques.

🚩 Problem Overview

With the rapid spread of information online, fake news has become a serious challenge. False or manipulated articles can influence public opinion and create misinformation. The goal of this project is to automatically determine whether a news article is real or fake.

💡 Approach

The solution uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to convert text into numerical features through TF-IDF vectorization. A Logistic Regression classifier is then trained on labeled data to predict the authenticity of news articles.
