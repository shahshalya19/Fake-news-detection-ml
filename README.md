# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project was created during a hackathon organized by **Google Developer Group (GDG) On Campus** and focuses on identifying misleading news content using machine learning techniques.

## 🚩 **Problem Overview**

With the rapid spread of information online, fake news has become a serious challenge. False or manipulated articles can influence public opinion and create misinformation. The goal of this project is to automatically determine whether a news article is **real or fake**.

## 💡 **Approach**

The solution uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to transform text into numerical representations using **TF-IDF vectorization**. A **Logistic Regression** classifier is trained on labeled data to predict the authenticity of news articles.

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  

## ▶️ **How to Execute**

- Open the provided notebook in **Google Colab**
- Run all cells sequentially
- Input a news article or text
- View the predicted result: **Real** or **Fake**

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

- Train the model on larger and more diverse datasets
- Experiment with advanced machine learning and deep learning models
- Deploy the system as a web application using Google-based platforms
